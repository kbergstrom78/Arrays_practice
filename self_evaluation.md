## Self Evaluation - Arrays
- I feel pretty confident in my knowledge of how arrays are formatted, the index positions, and how different methods can manipulate them.
- I'm still a little unclear on how ruby code that is written in terminal actually runs and how to "test" the arrays and methods, and I'm also a little concerned that maybe I misunderstood the intent of this CFU.
- I'm looking forward to more practice with arrays and the different methods that are most useful
